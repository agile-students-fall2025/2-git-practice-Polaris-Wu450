## Interesting Article I want to share (read recently)
[for anyone worried about being replaced by AI](https://ineslee.substack.com/p/tsp?r=e19oy) by Ines Lee, PhD

## Why This Article Resonates
This article tackles one of the most pressing questions for anyone in tech today: **how do we stay relevant when AI is rapidly automating parts of our jobs?** 

What I find particularly compelling is the author's analytical approach to deconstructing this problem:

#### 1. The "Task Bundle" Framework
The author uses a concept that feels very familiar from ML - viewing jobs not as monolithic roles, but as **bundles of tasks that can be unbundled and rebundled**. Just like how we decompose complex ML problems into smaller, manageable components, she shows how AI will gradually automate specific tasks within our jobs, forcing us to adapt and recompose our skill sets.

#### 2. T-Shaped Professional as the Solution
Rather than suggesting we all become generalists or hyper-specialists, Lee advocates for the **T-shaped professional model**:
- **Vertical depth**: Deep expertise in one core area (your "root")
- **Horizontal breadth**: Functional knowledge across adjacent domains (your "reach")
- **Cross-functional skills**: Universal human capabilities like critical thinking and collaboration

### Why This Matters to Me
As someone interested in both technical depth and architectural thinking, this framework validates what I've been experiencing. AI excels at automating trivial and repetitive coding tasks, but it still struggles with:
- **High-level system design and architecture tradeoffs**
- **Cross-domain synthesis and integration**
- **Strategic technical decision-making**

The article reinforces my belief that while AI handles the mundane work, there's increasing value in **full-stack thinking** - understanding not just how to implement solutions, but how different components interact, what the tradeoffs are, and how technical decisions impact the broader system.

This shift from heads-down coding to strategic technical leadership feels both inevitable and exciting. The T-shaped model provides a concrete framework for navigating this transition in the AI era.
